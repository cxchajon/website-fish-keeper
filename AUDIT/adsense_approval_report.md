## Validation Log
- Lighthouse audit (Performance/Accessibility/SEO, local CLI): **Not Run** — npm registry access returned 403 (see container log `b59f92`).
- FAQ JSON-LD (Google Rich Results Test): **Pending** — external validator requires interactive browser session not available in container.

## Ad Slot Placement Review
- Prototype ad placeholders added below Quick Answers, between heaters/filters, mid-page after Water Quality & Maintenance Essentials, and above the "Next Step: Cycle Your Tank" CTA. All are labeled data-slot="adsense-proto-*" and styled to reserve space without disrupting reading flow on desktop and ≤390px breakpoints.

## Source & Version Notes
- 2025-11-01 17:37 UTC — Prototype Gear updated per Gemini + AdSense recommendations (metadata, Quick Answers, FAQ JSON-LD, thin-section expansion, ad-slot placeholders, trust links).
