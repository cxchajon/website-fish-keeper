## FAQ List (Human-Readable)
What size heater do I need for a 20-gallon aquarium? ➜ Choose a 100W adjustable heater capable of holding a steady 76–78°F in a room that drops to 68°F.
How much filtration should I run on a 40 breeder? ➜ Aim for a filter rated 5–7x the tank volume per hour (200–280 GPH) with biomedia plus mechanical pads you can rinse weekly.
Can I skip an air pump if my filter agitates the surface? ➜ A strong filter return may oxygenate the tank, but a backup air pump keeps fish safe during summer heat waves or power outages.
What light spectrum grows easy aquarium plants? ➜ Look for full-spectrum LEDs around 6,500–7,500K with PAR 30–50 at substrate for low-to-medium plants like Java fern and crypts.
How often should I replace filter media? ➜ Rinse sponge or ceramic media in tank water every 2–4 weeks and only replace carbon or polishing pads when they stop flowing freely.
Do I need a lid on my community tank? ➜ Yes—tight-fitting lids limit evaporation, keep jumpy fish like tetras safe, and maintain heater efficiency.
