        <p>Shipping puts shrimp through temperature changes, low oxygen conditions, and a closed water environment that can shift quickly during transit. The moment a package arrives, conditions are already different from when it left the seller.</p>

        <p>This guide focuses on early decision-making: how to open the box, when to slow down, and how to avoid avoidable losses during the first 24 hours.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Receiving the Package</h2>

        <p>Before opening the bag, note the water temperature and clarity. Cold winter shipments can arrive with chilled water, while warm-weather shipments can arrive with low oxygen. Take a moment to assess rather than rushing into a long acclimation process.</p>

        <p>Keep the bag upright, minimize shaking, and avoid introducing the shipping water directly into the display tank.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Winter Handling and Temperature Shifts</h2>

        <p>In cold months, shrimp often arrive with cooled water. A quick temperature match can reduce stress, but sudden warming can shift ammonia into a more toxic form. Gradual acclimation gives more control when winter deliveries arrive unusually cold.</p>

        <p>If the bag water is significantly colder than the tank, allow a slow adjustment rather than a rapid warm-up. The goal is to move shrimp toward stable parameters without spiking stress in the bag.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Ammonia Considerations During Acclimation</h2>

        <p>Shipping water can accumulate ammonia over time. Opening the bag changes gas exchange and can alter the water chemistry. If the bag water smells strong or looks cloudy, prioritize a gentle transfer into fresh, conditioned water.</p>

        <p>Slow, controlled exchanges reduce shock while limiting prolonged exposure to degraded shipping water.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Stepwise Acclimation Process (Gradual Cup Method)</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Add a small amount of tank water to the bag</li>
          <li>After 10 minutes, gently remove water</li>
          <li>Add fresh system water again</li>
          <li>Repeat every 10 minutes for four rounds</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After the final round, transfer shrimp using a net or a clean container, leaving shipping water behind.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What to Watch in the First 24 Hours</h2>

        <p>Early observations provide better guidance than assumptions. Active movement, steady posture, and gradual exploration are typical signs of adjustment. Prolonged motionlessness, frequent flips, or repeated attempts to escape can indicate stress.</p>

        <p>Keep lights low, avoid feeding immediately, and allow the tank environment to remain stable. The first day is about monitoring, not intervention.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>When to Pause or Slow Down</h2>

        <p>If shrimp are unresponsive or the bag water is severely degraded, reduce the time spent in transit water and focus on gentle, controlled transfers. If the shrimp appear stable, slow acclimation is still appropriate without extending the process beyond what the water quality allows.</p>

        <p>Each shipment is different, so the best path is usually the one that keeps transitions measured and avoids sudden changes in temperature or chemistry.</p>
