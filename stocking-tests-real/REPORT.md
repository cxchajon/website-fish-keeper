# Stocking Test Report (Real Species Library)

## Overview
- Test harness: custom Node runner (`npm test`)
- Total test files: 5
- Total tests: 13
- Status: **All tests passed**

Artifacts:
- Summary: `out/jest-summary.txt`
- JUnit XML: `out/jest-junit.xml`
- Adapter audit: `out/adapter_issues.json` / `out/adapter_issues.md`
- Random failure sampler: `out/failing_combos.csv`

## Adapter Issues
The adapter flagged **0** species records. Ranges and flags normalized without schema conflicts. (See `out/adapter_issues.md`.)

## Notes
- No brackish-only species are present in the current library; salinity mismatch checks were skipped with a note logged in `failing_combos.csv`.
