          <figcaption>Dense stem plants and floaters give a community betta the cover and line-of-sight breaks it needs to stay calm.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Start with the right footprint</h2>
        <p>Ten-gallon kits get all the attention, but a community betta really settles in once you step up to <strong>20 gallons or more</strong>. The extra horizontal space lets schooling fish pass through without spooking your betta, and it makes it easier to build multiple territories. Pick a long tank over a tall cube so everyone has room to dodge.</p>
        <p>Layer the substrate in two zones: nutrient-rich planting soil in the back half for stems and swords, and a softer sand foreground for corydoras or loaches. Add a few pieces of driftwood and dragon stone to anchor plants while splitting sight lines. If you’re starting from scratch, cycle the tank fishless with a seeded sponge to avoid exposing the betta to ammonia spikes.</p>

        <h2>Curate a peaceful stock list</h2>
        <p>Go slow and treat your betta like the final boss who enters last. Build a peaceful baseline first with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mid-water schoolers</strong> like ember, neon, or green neon tetras.</li>
          <li><strong>Bottom crew</strong> such as pygmy corydoras or kuhli loaches that stay out of the betta’s upper territory.</li>
          <li><strong>Cleanup inverts</strong> like nerite snails that the betta can’t harass easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid fin-nippers (tiger barbs, serpae tetras), flashy male guppies, and other labyrinth fish. When in doubt, run your idea through the <a href="https://thetankguide.com/tools/stocking-advisor.html">Tank Guide Stocking Advisor</a>. It flags aggression gaps, fin-nipping risk, and bioload so you don’t stack too many semi-aggressive personalities together.</p>

          <figcaption>A curious betta checking out the room isn’t automatically a warning sign—watch for flaring or tail swipes before stepping in.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Dial in flow, heat, and cover</h2>
        <p>Betta fins catch current like a sail, so stick with a gentle sponge filter or a canister with a spray bar aimed at the glass. Keep temperatures steady between <strong>78–80°F</strong>, check that the heater is fully submerged, and verify the thermostat with a digital thermometer. Stable warmth keeps labyrinth fish breathing easier.</p>
        <p>Create a floating canopy with red root floaters or water lettuce so the betta can rest under cover. I also add a floating log or breeder basket flipped sideways to give a defined territory. The more layers you add—leaf litter, mid-level stems, and low-growing crypts—the more chances your schooling fish have to slip away from a grumpy flare.</p>

          </picture>
          <figcaption>From above you can see the balance: floating plants for the betta, open corridors for schoolers to zip across without entering his bubble.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Introduce and observe like a referee</h2>
        <p>Once the community is stable, add the betta at dusk with the lights dimmed. Let the fish acclimate in a breeder box for 20–30 minutes so you can gauge their interest. Release the betta near a densely planted corner rather than the open front glass. It’s normal for him to take a lap around the perimeter, flare once or twice, then settle.</p>
        <p>For the first week, run mini check-ins during feeding times and an hour after lights out. You’re looking for tail shredding, relentless chasing, or stress stripes. If he won’t stop patrolling, rearrange décor to break his mental map. Worst case, move him back to a solo tank and try a calmer male or a female down the road.</p>

          </picture>
          <figcaption>Gentle flow and consistent heat make a bigger difference than people think—both help burn off nervous energy.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Keep everyone fed without overdoing it</h2>
        <p>Bettas learn quickly that community tanks mean more food, so split rations into two or three micro-meals. Combine floating betta pellets with a sinking staple for the schoolers so everyone eats at their own level. Fast the entire tank one day per week and swap in frozen daphnia or baby brine shrimp for variety. The cleaner the feeding schedule, the less reason the betta has to shoulder-check neon tetras at the surface.</p>

        <h2>Maintenance that keeps the peace</h2>
        <p>Weekly water changes in the 25–35% range, gentle gravel vacs, and filter squeezes in tank water keep parameters steady. Trim stems aggressively to maintain open swim lanes, and thin floating plants when they block more than 70% of the surface. Every month, check fins for fraying, test for ammonia/nitrite just to be safe, and verify the heater is still within a half degree of your target.</p>
        <p>When a betta suddenly ramps up aggression, run through a quick checklist: Did the school shrink below six fish? Is the room brighter, causing reflections? Did you skip maintenance and let organics build up? Reset each variable one by one before assuming the fish “turned mean.”</p>

              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">Can a male betta live peacefully in a community aquarium?</h3>
              <p>Yes—when the tank is large and planted, and the betta goes in last. Keep at least six schooling fish so they feel confident swimming together, and make sure your betta has two or three resting spots that sit above the school’s traffic pattern.</p>

              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">Which tank mates are safest with a betta fish?</h3>
              <p>Stick with nano schoolers like neon, ember, or glowlight tetras paired with peaceful bottom dwellers. Avoid anything that might nip fins, flash bright tails, or hover in the same layer of water as the betta.</p>

              <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">How do you stop a betta from chasing tank mates?</h3>
              <p>Spread meals out, trim plants to maintain “escape lanes,” and reset décor if he starts patrolling nonstop. Persistent bullying is your cue to move him into his own tank before damage happens.</p>
