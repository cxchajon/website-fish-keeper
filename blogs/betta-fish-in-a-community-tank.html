      <h2>🧠 Introduction</h2>
      <p>Many aquarists assume bettas must live alone — but that’s not always true.</p>
      <p>Most people searching for betta info hit the same wall:</p>
      <p><em>“Keep them alone in a 5-gallon tank, and you’ll be fine.”</em></p>
      <p>That’s what I read too when I got back into the hobby. The reason always given is simple — you never know what kind of temperament your betta will have. But over time, through research and observation, I learned there’s more to the story. With the right setup, bettas can absolutely thrive in a community tank — not as bullies, but as balanced, curious leaders of their own little ecosystem.</p>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h3>🌿 My Journey Back Into the Hobby</h3>
      <p>When I got back into the hobby, I planned a divided 20-gallon—safe, predictable, two separate scapes. But I wanted more. I wanted to see if a betta could actually thrive in a community. So I scrapped the divider and went all-in on a planted community tank instead.</p>
      <p>I stocked peaceful species first — cherry barbs and cardinal tetras — fish that kept to themselves and rarely caused trouble. After that, I brought in my betta, Walter Mitty, named after the movie character with his wild imagination.</p>

      <figure>

             alt="Betta meeting a visitor’s finger at the glass."
             loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Bold and aware. He tracks movement outside the glass—always curious, never hiding.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h3>🧩 Establishing Order</h3>
      <p>At first, Walter darted at the other fish, and I worried it was aggression. But when I watched closely, I saw a pattern: he never actually made contact. It wasn’t about harm — it was about establishing his place in the tank’s pecking order. Over time, he became the tank’s peacekeeper — breaking up fights between barbs and patrolling the area like a guardian.</p>
      <p>He’d go after the cherry barbs because they were the most active swimmers, but their small size and peaceful nature made them safe companions—he never attacked them. Whenever I approached, he’d investigate first, always aware, always watching. That’s when I realized — in a well-balanced community, a betta can become the calm authority rather than the chaos everyone warns about.</p>

      </figure>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h3>⚠️ The Apisto Experiment</h3>
      <p>One day, I tried introducing an Apistogramma. While acclimating the bag, Walter flared instantly. That’s when I learned a key rule:</p>
      <p><strong>Bettas see fish of similar size and shape as rivals.</strong></p>
      <p>The Apisto went to another tank, and peace remained. It was a good reminder that betta compatibility isn’t just about temperament — it’s about silhouette, space, and dominance cues. Walter taught me that lesson clearly, and it shaped how I chose tankmates from that point forward.</p>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h3>🌈 Saying Goodbye &amp; Starting Again</h3>
      <p>Walter lived a few good years. When he got sick, I tried everything I could — different remedies, water changes, mild treatments — hoping he’d recover. Unfortunately, he developed that spinal issue where the back arches, and eventually, he couldn’t swim right.</p>
      <p>It was rough. I eventually had to euthanize him using the clove oil method recommended by veterinary guidance — one of the hardest moments I’ve had in fishkeeping.</p>
      <p>But his legacy taught me a lot. When I set up my new 29-gallon planted tank with a 5-gallon sump, I applied everything I’d learned — and the new betta thrived.</p>

      <h2>🌊 Behavior in a Balanced Tank</h2>
      <p>In my 29-gallon sump-filtered setup, my betta is the quiet king. He checks on every corner, investigates my hand when I reach in, and doesn’t bother shrimp or snails.</p>
      <p>He even “patrols” when the cherry barbs squabble — the same way Walter used to. The current is gentle thanks to a Random Flow Generator nozzle and a gate valve, keeping the flow calm but steady.</p>
      <p>He’s not just decoration — he’s part of the ecosystem. And watching him settle into that role confirmed everything Walter had taught me: given the right conditions, bettas don’t dominate through aggression—they lead through presence.</p>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h2>🌿 Why Bettas Belong in Planted Communities</h2>
      <p>Here’s what made it work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Give space</strong> — especially horizontal swimming room. Bettas breathe from the surface using their labyrinth organ, but they patrol horizontally across their territory.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Keep water pristine.</strong> Don’t rely on their “hardy” label; they tolerate poor conditions briefly, but thrive only with consistency. Ammonia spikes and temperature swings stress them quickly.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Provide plants with broad leaves</strong> — like java fern or anubias — they love to rest or perch on them.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Avoid fin-nippers or flashy fish</strong> — tiger barbs, male guppies, angelfish, or other long-finned species often trigger aggression.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Add the betta last.</strong> Let the community aquarium setup establish first so the betta blends in rather than claiming the whole tank.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pro-tip">💧 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep conditions stable around 78 °F (25 °C) with gentle flow and a pH between 6.8 – 7.4 for best results.</p>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h2>🧮 Planning Your Own Betta Community</h2>
      <p>If you’re thinking about building your own betta-friendly setup, planning goes a long way. Peaceful betta tankmates, flow strength, and filtration all affect how balanced the tank will be.</p>
      <p>Before you start stocking, try our <strong><a href="/stocking-advisor.html">Stocking Advisor</a></strong> — it helps you estimate bioload, compatibility, and filtration strength for your exact setup. It’s the same logic I use when designing my own tanks, and it’ll save you the kind of guesswork that cost Walter Mitty his Apisto tankmate.</p>

      <div class="section-divider" aria-hidden="true"></div>

      <h2>🐟 Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Bettas get a bad reputation because of misunderstanding. In reality, with space, plants, clean water, and compatible tankmates, they bring life, movement, and personality to a planted community.</p>
      <p>They’ll establish their order, but it’s rarely violent. It’s confidence — like a rooster establishing the pecking order: posturing, not violence.</p>
      <p>Give them what they need, respect their instincts, and you’ll see what I see:</p>
      <p><strong>A true king of the tank — calm, curious, and utterly captivating.</strong></p>
