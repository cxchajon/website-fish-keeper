      </header>

      <p>I’ve had Black Beard Algae for years. Back when this tank was a 20-long, it was my sandbox. I ran air stones, sponge filters, hacked HOBs with cut-to-fit sponges, went blackwater, chased reds—you name it. I wasn’t reckless; I knew how to keep fish happy at a minimum. The fun was bending the rules and seeing what else was possible.</p>

      <p>I used to follow the “let the tank do its thing” philosophy—no chemicals. Later I warmed up to startup helpers like Seachem Stability, and that shifted my thinking. One habit that didn’t help: the tank sat by the living room TV, so the lights were often on with no timer. Today the light runs a proper plant-first spectrum (no extra white spikes) on a schedule. I’m on a Finnex 24/7 with a custom program.</p>

      <p>When I upgraded to a 29-gallon with a sump, I wanted a clean top—no gear hanging off the rim. It looked great… except the Black Beard Algae kept coming back. People call BBA a lifetime algae. I used to justify it as “still a plant, still photosynthesizing.” What I missed: it was robbing nutrients and light from the plants I actually wanted.</p>

      <h2>What was feeding my BBA</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inconsistent lighting (no timer back then) and the wrong spectrum</li>
        <li>Plant melt left in the tank—dying tissue leaks compounds BBA loves</li>
        <li>Uneven flow—dead spots let BBA settle and hold ground</li>
        <li>Fertilizer timing vs. uptake—when growth stalls, nutrients linger</li>
      </ul>

      <figure class="blog-image left">

             onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/media/placeholder-16x9.svg';" />
        <figcaption>During: the red transition phase as spot-dosed BBA begins to die.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Fixing those set the stage: I stabilized the light, added a refugium in the sump to eat excess nutrients, and switched to a random flow generator—more coverage, gentler push, fewer stagnant pockets. Then I tackled the algae itself.</p>

      <h2>The breakthrough: spot-dosing (the right way)</h2>
      <p>I’d tried Seachem Excel before and didn’t love it because I used it like “liquid CO₂.” It isn’t. Used correctly as a targeted algaecide, it’s a different story.</p>

      <h3>My routine</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Kill flow for 10–15 minutes (return pump + air) so the water is still.</li>
        <li>Load a pipette with ~2&nbsp;ml of Excel.</li>
        <li>Spot-dose the patch—get the tip close and gently bathe the BBA.</li>
        <li>Optional: add one capful over the surface for the whole tank (only on water-change days).</li>
        <li>Wait 10–15 minutes, then restore flow.</li>
      </ol>

      <figure class="blog-image right">
        <img src="/blogs/blackbeard/img/Excel_spotdose_placeholder.jpg" alt="Spot dosing Excel onto Black Beard Algae with a pipette"
             onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/media/placeholder-16x9.svg';" />
        <figcaption>Spot dosing with a pipette—flow paused so the dose sits on target.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><strong>What you’ll see:</strong> by day 2–3 that patch turns deep red, then shrivels and lets go. You’ll need to clean intakes/screens for a bit because dead BBA breaks loose—small price for visible progress.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Safety notes</strong><br>
        Excel can melt sensitive plants if overdone. Go easy with shrimp tanks. Don’t combine heavy Excel and peroxide spot-treatments on the same day. Stay within the manufacturer’s max daily dose when combining spot + water-column dosing.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The upkeep that keeps it gone</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prune melt right away—don’t let dying leaves feed BBA.</li>
        <li>Keep a real photoperiod (timer) and plant-first spectrum; no “extra white for brightness.”</li>
        <li>Healthy flow with a random flow generator = fewer footholds.</li>
        <li>Refugium = nutrient sink (huge help in the sump).</li>
        <li>Keep nitrates readable (I like 5–15&nbsp;ppm). My plants now crash nitrates fast, so I test daily and dose accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>After: treated areas cleaned up; new growth takes over.</figcaption>

             onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/media/placeholder-16x9.svg';" />
        <figcaption>Current: working left-to-right; half clean, half to go.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>TL;DR: My BBA playbook</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fix the environment first: timer + plant spectrum, better flow, remove melt, add refugium.</li>
        <li>Spot-dose Excel with pump + air off for 10–15 min; ~2&nbsp;ml per patch.</li>
        <li>Expect red → shrivel → release by day 2–3; clean intakes.</li>
        <li>Keep nitrates in range and prune early so BBA has nothing to eat.</li>
        <li>Repeat on stragglers; it’s work, but it’s consistently effective.</li>
      </ol>
