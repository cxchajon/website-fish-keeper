      <h1 itemprop="headline">BBA Gone: How I Finally Beat Black Beard Algae (Spot Dose Guide)</h1>
      <p class="kicker" itemprop="description">My exact spot-dosing routine, lighting &amp; flow fixes, and sump refugium tweaks that finally beat BBA—safely.</p>

      <p>I’ve had Black Beard Algae for years. Back when this tank was a 20-long, it was my sandbox. I ran air stones, sponge filters, hacked HOBs with cut-to-fit sponges, went blackwater, chased reds—you name it. I wasn’t reckless; I knew how to keep fish happy at a minimum. The fun was bending the rules and seeing what else was possible.</p>

      <p>I used to follow the “let the tank do its thing” philosophy—no chemicals. Later I warmed up to startup helpers like Seachem Stability, and that shifted my thinking. One habit that didn’t help: the tank sat by the living room TV, so the lights were often on with no timer. Today the light runs a proper plant-first spectrum (no extra white spikes) on a schedule. I’m on a Finnex 24/7 with a custom program.</p>

      <h2>Why I Stopped Tolerating Black Beard Algae</h2>
      <p>When I upgraded to a 29-gallon with a sump, I wanted a clean top—no gear hanging off the rim. It looked great… except the Black Beard Algae kept coming back. People call BBA a lifetime algae. I used to justify it as “still a plant, still photosynthesizing.” What I missed: it was robbing nutrients and light from the plants I actually wanted.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inconsistent lighting (no timer back then) and the wrong spectrum</li>
        <li>Plant melt left in the tank—dying tissue leaks compounds BBA loves</li>
        <li>Uneven flow—dead spots let BBA settle and hold ground</li>
        <li>Fertilizer timing vs. uptake—when growth stalls, nutrients linger</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Experiments: Why Liquid Carbon Dosing Didn’t Work</h2>
      <!-- TODO: add internal link to Seachem Excel guide when available -->
      <p>I’d tried Seachem Excel before and didn’t love it because I used it like “liquid CO₂.” It isn’t. Used correctly as a targeted algaecide, it’s a different story.</p>

      <h2>The Game Changer: How to Spot Dose Seachem Excel for BBA</h2>
      <h3>Step-by-Step: The Still Water Technique</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Turn off the flow</strong> — pumps and air off for about 10–15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Load the pipette</strong> — around 2ml of Seachem Excel.</li>
        <li><strong>Spot dose</strong> — aim right at the BBA patch until it lightly clouds over.</li>
        <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> — one capful over the surface (especially during water changes).</li>
        <li><strong>Wait 10–15 minutes</strong> — then restore flow.</li>
      </ol>

             onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/media/placeholder-16x9.svg';" />
        <figcaption>During: the red transition phase as BBA begins to die.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><strong>What you’ll see:</strong> by day 2–3 that patch turns deep red, then shrivels and lets go. You’ll need to clean intakes/screens for a bit because dead BBA breaks loose—small price for visible progress.</p>
      <p><strong>That’s when the Amano shrimp move in. They won’t touch it in its black, coarse form — but once it softens and turns red, they eat it like crazy.</strong></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Safety notes</strong><br>
        Excel can melt sensitive plants if overdone. Go easy with shrimp tanks. Don’t combine heavy Excel and peroxide spot-treatments on the same day. Stay within the manufacturer’s max daily dose when combining spot + water-column dosing.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Long-Term BBA Fix: Light, Flow, and Nutrients</h2>
      <p>Fixing those set the stage: I stabilized the light, added a refugium in the sump to eat excess nutrients, and switched to a random flow generator—more coverage, gentler push, fewer stagnant pockets. Then I tackled the algae itself.</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Fixing the Light Spectrum (No More Extra Whites!)</h3>
      <p>Keep a real photoperiod (timer) and plant-first spectrum; no “extra white for brightness.”</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Boosting Flow with a Random Flow Generator</h3>
      <p>Healthy flow with a random flow generator = fewer footholds.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Refugium Power (Starving the Algae)</h3>
      <!-- TODO: add internal link to refugium guide when available -->
      <p>Refugium = nutrient sink (huge help in the sump).</p>
      <p>Prune melt right away—don’t let dying leaves feed BBA.</p>

             onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/media/placeholder-16x9.svg';" />
        <figcaption>After: treated areas cleared; new growth takes over.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Managing My New Problem: Zero Nitrates (The Dosing Life)</h2>
      <p>Keep nitrates readable (I like 5–15&nbsp;ppm). My plants now crash nitrates fast, so I test daily and dose accordingly.</p>

      <h2>TL;DR: My BBA playbook</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Fix the environment first: timer + plant spectrum, better flow, remove melt, add refugium.</li>
        <li>Spot-dose Excel with pump + air off for 10–15 min; ~2&nbsp;ml per patch.</li>
        <li>Expect red → shrivel → release by day 2–3; clean intakes.</li>
        <li>Keep nitrates in range and prune early so BBA has nothing to eat.</li>
        <li>Repeat on stragglers; it’s work, but it’s consistently effective.</li>
      </ol>
