# Legacy Filtration UI Removal Audit

## Modified Assets
- `prototype/stocking-prototype.html`
  - Added prototype-only suppression style and mutation neutralizer.
  - Removed the legacy `#filtration-trigger` placeholder and cache-busted prototype asset tags.
- `prototype/assets/js/proto-guards.js`
  - Expanded defensive selector list to purge any residual legacy filtration markup.
- `prototype/assets/js/proto-popovers.js`
  - (Cache-busted reference in HTML; file contents unchanged.)
- `prototype/assets/js/filtration.js`
  - (Cache-busted reference in HTML; file contents unchanged.)
- `prototype/assets/css/proto-popovers.css`
  - Removed unused rules that targeted the legacy filtration tooltip trigger host.
- `prototype/assets/css/prototype.css`
  - Broadened guard selectors to match additional legacy filtration nodes.
- `prototype/assets/css/filtration.css`
  - (Cache-busted reference in HTML; file contents unchanged.)

## Instrumentation Notes
- The provided mutation-observer and append/insert instrumentation could not be executed in this environment (no browser access). No runtime stack traces were captured.

## Screenshot Checklist
- `prototype/audit_out/pre-mobile.png` — **not captured** (headless environment).
- `prototype/audit_out/pre-desktop.png` — **not captured** (headless environment).
- `prototype/audit_out/post-mobile.png` — **not captured** (headless environment).
- `prototype/audit_out/post-desktop.png` — **not captured** (headless environment).

## Math Utilities Verification
- The filtration math utilities that power the chip UI remain untouched in `prototype/js/proto-filtration.js` (rendering logic unchanged and still invoked via `window.renderFiltration`).

## Additional Notes
- A prototype-only inline style and mutation observer now remove any late-injected legacy filtration elements, preventing hydration reinsertion.
