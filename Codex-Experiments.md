# Codex Experiments Log — Observation & Behavior Record (October 4, 2025)
This file complements the **AI-Learning-Journal.md**.  
While that file captures insights about *how the user learns*, this one captures *what Codex does* — every test, behavior, and unexpected reaction.

## Purpose
To create a running experimental log that documents:
- What prompts were given to Codex  
- What Codex produced in response  
- How accurate or successful the outcome was  
- Any anomalies, errors, or “ghost moments” that occurred  
- Lessons learned about how Codex interprets human instructions

Each entry should be dated and include these four sections:
1. **Prompt Summary** – the task or instruction sent to Codex.  
2. **Result** – what Codex actually did (file created, lines changed, errors, etc.).  
3. **Analysis** – observations about why Codex might have acted that way.  
4. **Next Adjustment** – what to change in the next iteration or how to refine future prompts.

## Initial Context (from current conversation)
- The user recently discovered that Codex can create and edit files directly inside ChatGPT’s Code Lab environment.  
- We are using Codex to generate two “journal-type” markdown files (`AI-Learning-Journal.md` and this one).  
- The goal is to study both human prompting patterns and AI execution reliability over time.  
- The user plans to log ghost moments, partial outputs, or unusual behavior as part of this study.

## Template Example
### [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]
**Prompt Summary:**  
_Describe the Codex instruction or audit you ran._

**Result:**  
_Summarize what Codex did — file created, edited, error message, or unexpected output._

**Analysis:**  
_Why might Codex have done that? Was the prompt clear? Did it need more structure?_

**Next Adjustment:**  
_What to test or refine next time._
