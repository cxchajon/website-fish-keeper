# Reviewer Experience Audit — TheTankGuide.com

## 1. Beginner Pathway Flow — Present
- Homepage launch grid guides visitors from Stocking Advisor to Gear, Cycling Coach, Media, and About with succinct blurbs and launch buttons that set expectations for each tool.【F:index.html†L194-L229】
- Stocking Advisor hands off to gear suggestions with inline CTA buttons and summary copy, keeping the journey moving.【F:stocking.html†L1405-L1433】
- Gear page reinforces next steps with a prominent "Next Step: Cycle Your Tank" block that links directly to Cycling Coach; however, the flow ends at Cycling Coach without an equivalent nudge toward Media or About, so the last hand-off relies on global navigation.【F:gear/index.html†L262-L269】【F:params.html†L743-L749】
- Beginner/advanced segmentation is uneven: Cycling Coach clearly walls off its advanced metrics in an optional disclosure, but the Stocking Advisor lacks an explicit Beginner mode toggle or copy that reassures novices about complexity.【F:params.html†L721-L743】

## 2. About Page Mission Integrity — Present
- Mission & Values copy explicitly anchors around approachability, DIY learning, respect for life, and community-first sharing, mirroring the brand promise of education, ethics, welfare, and community.【F:about.html†L355-L364】
- Owner Story and Teaching & Inspiration panels read as personal, candid narratives describing early struggles, learning mindset, and dedication to teaching rather than marketing spin, lending authenticity.【F:about.html†L327-L347】
- Mission section encourages community participation via Feature Your Tank references, reinforcing transparency and inclusion.【F:about.html†L320-L333】

## 3. Transparency & Trust — Visible
- Core tools expose their logic through inline tooltips that define metrics like ammonia, nitrite, and bioload, while Stocking Advisor surfaces safety warnings when limits are exceeded.【F:params.html†L604-L669】【F:stocking.html†L1398-L1403】
- Cycling Coach keeps advanced toxic NH₃ math optional but explained, and points readers to a "Sources & Further Reading" link — though the destination lacks a dedicated reference list, creating a slight follow-through gap.【F:params.html†L721-L743】
- Affiliate and advertising disclosures sit near relevant CTAs (gear affiliate note, media feature card, site footer), signaling monetization clearly.【F:gear/index.html†L101-L108】【F:media.html†L503-L510】【F:footer.html†L44-L52】

## 4. Community & Media Presence — Passive
- Media hub balances branded content with curated community picks and an open call to submit tanks, spotlighting both original and community voices.【F:media.html†L387-L515】
- Feature Your Tank form exists but requires multi-platform follows, verification, and promotional tagging commitments, which may discourage casual beginners from participating despite the invitation.【F:feature-your-tank.html†L354-L380】
- About page also invites sharing stories, yet there’s no rotating gallery or testimonials live on-site, leaving the community presence more aspirational than active.【F:about.html†L320-L333】

## 5. Tone & Readability — Educational (Grade ~6–8)
- Tool intros favor short, directive sentences (e.g., “Enter today’s readings for a clear snapshot”) and friendly reassurance, supporting a teacherly tone.【F:params.html†L581-L669】
- Mission and media blurbs remain conversational, but some long paragraphs (Owner Story, Feature Your Tank eligibility rules) push the reading level upward and could benefit from tighter chunking for beginners.【F:about.html†L327-L335】【F:feature-your-tank.html†L354-L362】
- Overall voice focuses on guidance and safety over sales pitches, aligning with an educational objective.【F:index.html†L190-L229】

## 6. Reviewer Perspective
**Likely verdict:** *Good* — Reviewers would commend the clear toolchain, mission sincerity, and transparent disclaimers, while noting the community program feels more gated than participatory.

**Mock external blurb:**
> “TheTankGuide.com lines up your aquarium journey step-by-step — plan stock, pick gear, and dial in cycling with free, transparent tools that explain every reading. The mission feels heartfelt and fish-first, even if the community showcase still needs more open, beginner-friendly participation.”
