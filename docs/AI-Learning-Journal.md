# AI Learning Journal — Explanation & Purpose (October 4, 2025)
This file is part of the user’s broader learning archive. It documents the exploration of how ChatGPT and Codex are used together — from initial curiosity to deep learning and workflow integration.

## Purpose
This file will serve as a continuous record of how the user learns to *learn AI itself*.  
The intent is to explore techniques for prompting, reflection, and Codex execution to better understand how to collaborate with large language models effectively.

## Current Context (Imported Conversation Summary)
- User discovered that Codex can create and alter files directly within the Code Lab environment.
- Decided to treat this capability as a hands-on way to study AI behavior.
- Recognized that Codex functions as the “hands” of the operation, while ChatGPT acts as the “mind.”
- This discovery came from a live dialogue about structuring reflective vs. execution prompts.

## Next Steps
- Continue recording discoveries as new entries.
- Each entry should include a date and a short context (what was learned, how it connects).
- Future updates may include comparisons of Codex output vs ChatGPT planning.
