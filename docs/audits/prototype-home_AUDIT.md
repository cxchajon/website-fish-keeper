## Post-Flight Summary
- Meta robots noindex,nofollow is blocking indexing and AdSense eligibility; remove before launch.
- No canonical link, Open Graph, or Twitter cards means shares and SERP snippets will be generic or absent.
- Lacks JSON-LD (Organization/WebSite/WebPage), hurting Google's understanding and eligibility for rich results.
- Repeated "Launch" link labels fail descriptive anchor best practices and weaken internal relevance signals.
- Hero lacks a primary CTA into the highest-priority workflow (e.g., Stocking Advisor), softening task completion cues.
- Long-form copy is strong but needs scannable sub-bullets or pull quotes to aid quick comprehension.
- Navigation/footer rely on deferred JS includes; add server-rendered fallbacks so policy links always load.
- Modal close icon is aria-hidden but ensure keyboard trap release timing passes manual QA after animation.
- Hero min-height 100dvh with layered gradients and heavy shadows may inflate LCP on low-powered devices.
- Fonts load from Google Fonts without font-display hints; add swap/fallback to reduce render delay.
- No imagery yet—add hero or card visuals with descriptive alt text to improve engagement and future ad placements.
- Cache-control no-store headers block caching and can slow repeat visits; reconsider for production build.
- Confirm robots.txt/sitemap exclude prototypes to avoid indexation conflicts once meta robots is relaxed.

## Executive Summary
- Prototype is intentionally blocked from indexing, but removing `noindex, nofollow` (and matching robots/sitemap rules) is mandatory before seeking AdSense approval or organic visibility.
- Head lacks canonical, social previews, structured data, and font-display hints, preventing rich snippets and slowing perceived performance.
- Hero communicates value but lacks a clear primary CTA into core tools; repeated "Launch" labels reduce clarity for screen readers and internal linking signals.
- Content depth is solid (≈450 words) yet could use scannable formatting (bullets, subhead highlights) and visual assets to boost engagement and ad inventory potential.
- JS-injected navigation/footer may delay access to compliance links; provide server-rendered fallbacks to meet policy requirements and improve crawlability.

## Meta Inventory & Recommendations
| Element | Current | Issues | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Title | "The Tank Guide — Prototype Home" | Prototype qualifier, keyword not forward-loaded | "Beginner Aquarium Guides & Tools | The Tank Guide" (≈53 chars) foregrounds keyword + brand |
| Meta Description | "Smart fishkeeping guides, planning tools, and step-by-step checklists to set up, stock, and care for your aquarium." | No CTA; could mention target audience | "Plan, cycle, and stock your freshwater aquarium with The Tank Guide's beginner workflows, calculators, and care checklists." (≈156 chars) |
| Meta Robots | `noindex,nofollow` | Blocks indexing & AdSense | Switch to `index,follow` once prototype is ready; coordinate with robots.txt/sitemap |
| Canonical | — | Missing; risk of duplicate handling | Add canonical to final production URL (e.g., `https://www.thetankguide.com/` or canonical prototype slug) |
| Open Graph Title | — | Missing social preview | Mirror SEO title in `og:title` |
| Open Graph Description | — | Missing share copy | Use refined meta description |
| Open Graph Image | — | No share image | Provide 1200x630 hero image featuring brand & aquascape |
| Twitter Card | — | No card data | Add `summary_large_image` + matching OG fields |

## Headings Map
| Level | Text | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | Fishkeeping Guides & Tools — The Tank Guide | Single H1 present; consider removing em dash phrase duplication with title |
| H2 | Stocking Advisor | Card heading; duplicates across hero tools grid |
| H2 | Gear | Card heading |
| H2 | Cycling Coach | Card heading |
| H2 | Media | Card heading |
| H2 | About | Card heading |
| H2 | Contact | Card heading |
| H2 | Aquarium Science, Simplified for Everyone | Long-form section |
| H2 | Master the Foundation: Understanding the Nitrogen Cycle | Long-form section |
| H2 | Build a Balanced Community with Our Stocking Advisor | Long-form section |
| H2 | Learn with Us: From Our Tank to Yours | Long-form section |
| H2 | How The Tank Guide Works | Modal dialog heading |
| H2 | About The Tank Guide | Visually hidden heading anchoring footer blurb |

## Body Copy Observations
- **Hero & Modal:** Clear value proposition and support brand authority, but hero lacks immediate CTA buttons into Stocking Advisor/Gear; modal copy is helpful yet hidden behind extra click.
- **Tools Grid:** Each card highlights purpose succinctly; however, repeated "Launch" CTAs reduce clarity. Consider descriptive buttons (e.g., "Plan my stocking list").
- **Long-form Sections:** Story-driven paragraphs build trust; break dense paragraphs into shorter sentences or bullets to improve scannability for new hobbyists.
- **Deep Blurb:** Reinforces mission but the parenthetical "(FKLCo)" feels internal—swap for consumer-friendly trust signal or remove.

## Links & Anchors
| Href | Anchor Text | Rel/Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /stocking.html | Launch | — | Internal link; anchor not descriptive—consider "Open Stocking Advisor" |
| /gear/ | Launch | — | Same anchor issue |
| /params.html | Launch | — | Same anchor issue |
| /media.html | Discover | — | Adequate but could be "Explore Media Hub" |
| /about.html | Learn more | — | Fine; ensure page has canonical |
| /contact-feedback.html | Contact & Feedback | — | Descriptive |
| /nav.html (async) | — | Loaded via JS include | Ensure crawlable fallback |
| /footer.html (async) | — | Loaded via JS include | Ensure compliance links render without JS |

## Images & Media
| Src | Alt | Role/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | No `<img>` elements present; add branded hero or tool screenshots with descriptive alt text for engagement and rich results |

## Structured Data
- No JSON-LD or microdata present. Add combined `Organization` + `WebSite` (with SearchAction) and page-level `WebPage` schema referencing primary target keyword and potential breadcrumb once live. Validate via Rich Results Test before launch.

## Accessibility Spot-Check
- Positive: Buttons use `:focus-visible` outlines; modal has `role="dialog"`, labelled heading, and focus trapping logic.
- Watchouts: Ensure overlay fade timing releases focus before animations end; repeated "Launch" link text is ambiguous for screen reader users; provide fallback navigation content if JS fails; confirm color contrast of white text on gradients meets WCAG AA.

## Performance & CWV Flags
- Google Fonts served without `font-display` hint—adds render-blocking risk for LCP.
- Hero uses full-viewport gradient, box shadows, and blur overlays; monitor for paint cost and large CLS risk if nav/hero height shifts during JS injection.
- Inline CSS block is large; consider extracting/minifying once stable.
- Deferred nav/footer fetches may delay layout completion; ensure placeholders reserve space to avoid CLS.

## AdSense Policy Readiness
| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original, substantial content | Pass | ~450 words of unique educational copy |
| Indexable / crawlable | Fail | `noindex,nofollow` prevents approval |
| Clear navigation + policy links | Needs follow-up | Links injected via JS; add static fallbacks |
| No prohibited content | Pass | Family-safe topic |
| Content before ads | Pass | Strong content-first layout; plan ad slots below hero |
| Page experience | Needs follow-up | Optimize LCP/INP via font-display, hero rendering, caching |

## Prioritized Fix Plan
- **P0:** Remove `noindex,nofollow`, add canonical URL, and publish JSON-LD before requesting AdSense review; confirm robots/sitemap alignment.
- **P0:** Provide server-rendered nav/footer fallback with visible Privacy Policy and Terms links to satisfy compliance even without JS.
- **P1:** Implement OG/Twitter metadata with share image; refresh title/description to highlight beginner aquarium focus and add CTA.
- **P1:** Replace generic "Launch" anchors with descriptive CTA text and add a primary hero CTA to key workflow.
- **P1:** Add font-display swap, right-size hero styling, and reserve layout space for async includes to improve LCP/CLS.
- **P2:** Introduce supportive visuals with alt text, break long paragraphs into bullets, and revisit deep blurb tone for consumer trust.
