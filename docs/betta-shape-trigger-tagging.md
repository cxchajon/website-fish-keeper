# Betta shape-trigger tagging

Added a new compatibility tag `betta_shape_trigger` to mark fish that often provoke aggression from male bettas because of similar silhouettes or long, flowing fins.

Tagged species (initial pass):

- **Guppy (Male)** – flashy, flowing tails frequently draw male betta strikes.
- **Dwarf Gourami** – male displays with elongated dorsal/anal fins mirror betta outline.
- **Honey Gourami** – similar labyrinth fish profile; males flare fins during breeding displays.
- **Pearl Gourami** – long, trailing ventral and dorsal fins plus labyrinth body shape.

The new warning rule fires when a **Betta (Male)** is kept with any species carrying `betta_shape_trigger`.
