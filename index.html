        <h2>Aquarium Science, Simplified for Everyone</h2>
        <p>Welcome to The Tank Guide, where we make the science of aquariums simple, beautiful, and accessible for everyone. We know that starting your first fish tank can feel like a deep dive into a world of complex chemistry and conflicting advice. Our mission is to be the clear, calm voice that guides you from confusion to confidence.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section proto-section" id="nitrogen-cycle">
        <h2>Master the Foundation: Understanding the Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
        <p>At the heart of every stable aquarium is one crucial process: the nitrogen cycle. It’s the invisible engine that turns fish waste into safer nitrates, creating a healthy environment for your aquatic life. Instead of just telling you about it, we’ve built the Cycling Coach—an interactive tool that lets you track your tank’s progress and understand each stage. This isn’t just data; it’s the foundation of responsible fishkeeping, and we’re here to walk you through every step.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section proto-section" id="stocking-advisor">
        <h2>Build a Balanced Community with Our Stocking Advisor</h2>
        <p>Once your tank is cycled and ready, the real fun begins: choosing your fish. But how many can you add? Will they get along? A healthy tank is a balanced ecosystem, not just a collection of pretty fish. That’s why we developed the Stocking Advisor. It goes beyond simple ‘one inch of fish per gallon’ rules, using logic based on bioload, behavior, and filtration capacity. Born from real-world research and testing, it helps you build a peaceful, thriving underwater community without the guesswork. Use it to test your ideas in real time and plan a tank that’s both beautiful and sustainable.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section proto-section" id="learn-with-us">
        <h2>Learn with Us: From Our Tank to Yours</h2>
        <p>Everything we teach is backed by real-world experience. Our guides and articles draw from ongoing research and testing, where we document everything from fertilizer dosing to fish behavior. Follow along on the Media Hub, where we share logs, videos, and insights. This is science in action, not just in theory.</p>
        <p>We believe that a successful aquarium is one of the most rewarding experiences a family can share. It’s a living piece of art and a constant lesson in biology. With the right knowledge and the right tools, you can create a stunning underwater world that lasts for years to come. Your journey starts here.</p>
