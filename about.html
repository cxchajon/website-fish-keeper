      <h3>Owner Story</h3>
      <p>Ever since I was a kid, I was drawn to aquariums. My uncle kept guppies for years, and whenever I visited my grandmother, I’d sit and stare at them. That fascination stuck with me.</p>
      <p>In 2011 or 2012, I caught a marathon of <em>Tanked</em> on Animal Planet. Their massive saltwater builds looked incredible, but freshwater seemed within reach. I decided it was finally time to try again—this time the right way.</p>
      <p>I picked up a 50-gallon kit from a chain store. Tank, stand, hang-on-back filter, gravel, lights—the whole package. After hours of assembling the stand upside down, it broke as I flipped it. I nearly gave up, but I exchanged it and started over.</p>
      <p>I filled the tank, added conditioner and “bacteria in a bottle,” and waited. A week later, nothing. Forums and YouTube became my lifeline. I tried a fishless cycle, then researched the safest way to do a fish-in cycle and chose hardy rasboras. Watching them school was amazing. Losing my first fish to a bad water change was crushing.</p>
      <p>From there, it was nonstop learning—daily water changes, ammonia battles, flooded kitchens from siphon hoses. When I discovered planted aquariums, everything changed. Plants balanced the tank, the cycle completed, and I was hooked.</p>
      <p>I experimented with stocking, filtration, lighting, and eventually DIY builds. Life forced me to downsize, but I kept going—bettas, shrimp, CO₂, dirted tanks, even custom sumps. Along the way I borrowed smart tricks from saltwater, like random-flow nozzles, and found pride in doing things myself.</p>
      <p>I went from having no one to talk to about the hobby, to meeting local fishkeepers with tank-filled rooms, and eventually meeting creators I once watched on YouTube at Aquashella.</p>
      <p>What hasn’t changed is why I keep at it: I love learning, I love tinkering, and I want to help new fishkeepers skip the mistakes I made and find the joy faster.</p>

      <h3>Teaching &amp; Inspiration</h3>
      <p>Outside of aquariums, I’ve also gotten to see the other side of how teachers prepare for their students—especially special education teachers. The sacrifice, patience, and dedication they show left a big impression on me.</p>
      <p>It made me realize that teaching, in any form, is hard work. But it’s also one of the most meaningful things you can do. That spirit drives The Tank Guide. We want every aquarist to feel confident, excited, and empowered to give their fish a healthy home.</p>
      <p>So whether you’re cycling your first tank, fine-tuning a high-tech planted setup, or getting advice before a big upgrade, we’re here to help you every step of the way.</p>

      <hr />

      <h3>What’s Next</h3>
      <p>We’re working on new tooling, more dynamic stocking guidance, and better personalization to match aquarists with the right care plans. Expect more calculators, deeper editorial content, and a growing library of community-driven insights.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in partnering, sharing feedback, or supporting the project, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
