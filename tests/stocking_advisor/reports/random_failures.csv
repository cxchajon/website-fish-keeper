# In a properly implemented system with the RBC model, this file should be EMPTY.
# Any entries here indicate logic bugs.
#
# Example of what failures would look like:
# 1,15,"Sponge:60GPH","5 tetras","Sponge increased bioload","65.3% → 67.1%"
# 2,30,"HOB:200GPH+Canister:300GPH","12 tetras","Order violation","Seq A: 42.1%, Seq B: 42.3%"
#
# In the SAMPLE run, all random tests passed with 0 failures.
