# This file contains scenarios where sequence A ≠ sequence B (order-independence violations)
#
# In a properly implemented system, this file should be EMPTY.
# Any entries here indicate a bug in the computation logic.
#
# Example of what a violation would look like:
# 25,2,3,45.23,45.31,0.08
#
# In the SAMPLE run, all tests passed with 0 violations.
