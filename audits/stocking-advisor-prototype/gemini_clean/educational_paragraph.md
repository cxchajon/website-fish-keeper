Every fish you preview in the Stocking Advisor contributes to the system's bioload, which is the sum of waste, respiration, and uneaten food the filters must process. That waste is converted from ammonia to nitrite and nitrate by beneficial bacteria living on hard surfaces. Keeping the nitrogen cycle stable means adding livestock slowly, rinsing filter media in dechlorinated water, and tracking test results so you can dial in water changes before nutrients creep beyond safe ranges.
