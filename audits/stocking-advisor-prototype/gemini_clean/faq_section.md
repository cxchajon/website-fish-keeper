Q: How does the prototype handle cycle readiness guidance?
A: It assumes a conservative cycle and highlights stocking ranges that protect against ammonia spikes, encouraging keepers to stagger additions and test water chemistry weekly.

Q: Can I compare different community presets in one session?
A: Yes. The prototype caches your current mix, letting you duplicate, rename, and iterate on scenarios so you can evaluate stocking density before pushing updates live.

Q: What data powers the compatibility alerts?
A: Gemini synthesizes our catalog of species records, tagging each fish with temperament, adult size, and parameter tolerances to surface conflicts the moment they appear in a plan.

Q: How should I report feedback on the prototype results?
A: Use the built-in send-feedback link in the results panel or drop a note in the #stocking-advisor Slack channel so the product team can review logs and reproduce the scenario.
