"Nitrogen Cycle","Explain cycling process","params.html","The nitrogen cycle converts fish waste from ammonia to nitrite to less harmful nitrate via beneficial bacteria."
"Ammonia","Warn about toxic ammonia","params.html","Ammonia (NH3/NH4+) is toxic to fish above 0 ppm; regular testing and water changes keep it safe."
"Nitrite","Warn about nitrite spikes","params.html","Nitrite (NO2-) stresses fish and should remain at 0 ppm once the tank is cycled."
"Nitrate","Highlight nitrate management","params.html","Nitrate (NO3-) builds up after cycling; keep under 40 ppm with water changes or plants."
"Beneficial Bacteria","Encourage bacterial support","params.html","Beneficial bacteria colonies live in filters and substrate, breaking down ammonia and nitrite."
"Bioload","Clarify stocking impact","stocking-advisor.html","Bioload is the waste load your fish produce; more fish means more filtration and maintenance."
"Stocking Density","Prevent overstocking","stocking-advisor.html","Stocking density balances fish size, behavior, and filtration so the tank is not overcrowded."
"Quarantine Tank","Promote isolation before stocking","stocking-advisor.html","A quarantine tank lets you observe new fish for illness before adding them to your display tank."
"Drip Acclimation","Advocate gentle acclimation","stocking-advisor.html","Drip acclimation slowly matches bag water to tank water to reduce shock when adding fish."
"Water Change","Highlight maintenance","index.html","Routine partial water changes remove waste and refresh minerals to keep fish healthy."
"General Hardness","Explain GH","params.html","General hardness (GH) measures dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium that fish need."
"Carbonate Hardness","Explain KH","params.html","Carbonate hardness (KH) stabilizes pH by buffering acids; aim for a stable range for your species."
"pH Swing","Warn about rapid pH changes","params.html","Rapid pH swings stress fish; adjust slowly and test water before major changes."
"Filter Media","Guide gear choices","gear/index.html","Filter media houses bacteria and removes debris; rinse gently in tank water to preserve colonies."
"Aquarium Heater","Assist gear selection","gear/index.html","A reliable heater maintains stable temperatures suited to your species; use a thermometer to verify."
