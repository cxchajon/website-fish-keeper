[2025-10-12 | Stocking Advisor | Real filter products + manual GPH + carryover]
Scope: Dual-input filter block; catalog-driven product list; auto-filled GPH; mild type factor; pass filter_id to Gear.
Result: Real-world filtration choices tied to Gear, with future-proofed highlighting.
Next: Gear page to auto-highlight filter_id product and factor planted/filter into suggestions.
[2025-10-12 | Stocking Advisor | Strict filter catalog eligibility]
Scope: Only show products whose tank_min_g ≤ tank_g ≤ tank_max_g; sort after filtering.
Result: Dropdown now matches our Gear categorization exactly.
[2025-10-12 | SA Products | Restore eligible dropdown (strict, inclusive, numeric)]
Scope: Robust catalog load; strict min≤g≤max; timed repopulation; explicit empty-state; debug console diffs.
Result: Products now appear only when truly eligible; no more blank dropdown.
[2025-10-13 | Stocking Advisor | Rated Flow made system-controlled]
Scope: Reordered controls; removed manual edits; auto-fill from product; neutral when none selected.
Result: Cleaner UX, fewer errors, and consistent cross-page handoff.
