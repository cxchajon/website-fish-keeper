    "body": "Pre–water change nitrate reading came in at 10 ppm. Performed a large water change: ~75% from the display tank and ~90% from the sump. One red cherry barb was lost today — part of the original aging group. Rinsed the sponge filters in tank water since replacements are currently unavailable (biofilm preserved). Light equipment wipe-down completed; no real algae present aside from a small amount of diatoms. System remains stable.",
