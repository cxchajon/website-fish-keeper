    "body": "A difficult entry to write. Following a routine water change on February 9, 2026, Prime was accidentally not added during the refill. Within 24 hours, significant fish loss was observed. Losses included: All Cardinal Tetras (long-term residents, over 8 years) and multiple Panda Loaches. Upon discovery, deceased fish were removed immediately to prevent secondary water quality issues. Invertebrates (shrimp and snails) had already begun scavenging, indicating rapid onset following exposure. Prime was dosed as soon as the issue was identified. Feeding was reduced to very light amounts, and Stability will be added to support biological recovery. Additional monitoring and potential mid-week water changes are planned to maintain stable parameters. This event appears to be an acute water conditioning error, not a systemic or long-term husbandry issue.",
