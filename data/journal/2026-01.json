    "body": "Performed a routine water change to close out the month. Pre–water change nitrate levels tested between 10–20 ppm, remaining within a stable range. Completed a normal water change using the usual large-volume method. During maintenance, Purigen was replaced along with the polyfill layer placed on top of it. The previous Purigen had been in use since mid-November, making this a scheduled and timely media refresh. Due to the media change, Stability was dosed to support beneficial bacteria and maintain biological balance. No other adjustments were made during this maintenance cycle. System remains stable heading into February.",

    "body": "Performed a routine weekly water change following a week of heavier fertilizer dosing. Pre–water change nitrate levels measured at approximately 40 ppm, consistent with increased nutrient input. Completed a standard large water change with approximately 95% of the sump and ~80% of the display drained. Completed a moderate trimming of pothos in the refugium, as growth had become dense. Trimmings were removed in preparation for propagation, helping maintain healthy nutrient uptake and prevent overcrowding. No other system adjustments were made during this maintenance session. Tank remains stable following maintenance.",

Completed the usual large maintenance drain with approximately 95% of the sump and ~80% of the display water removed. Completed light replanting of the tri-color lotus, repositioning growth for better spacing and continued development. No other major changes were made during this maintenance session.

    "body": "Performed routine maintenance and a partial water change. Pre–water change nitrate levels tested between 20–40 ppm (below 40), and the display tank was drained by about 50%, less than usual, because extra filter maintenance was completed during this session. All filter media were temporarily removed and gently squeezed out in tank water, and the filter chamber was cleaned to remove accumulated detritus and suspended particles, making this a maintenance-focused reset rather than a corrective water change. Newly added shrimp introduced 2–3 days prior are acclimating well and showing active, exploratory behavior throughout the tank. Inkbird temperature probes were moved from the sump back into the display tank to improve monitoring and regulation during water changes, with a dedicated sump heater considered for the future.",

    "body": "Updated the display and sump/refugium lighting schedule with a gentle, split increase to encourage soft green algae as a natural food source for snails and shrimp while keeping the system balanced. Extended the photoperiod by adding 15 minutes to both dawn and dusk, and lengthened refugium lighting with intentional overlap. Moss growth in the refugium has been strong, signaling the system can handle the slightly longer light window.",

    "body": "Performed the first water change of 2026 as part of routine system maintenance. Pre–water change nitrate levels measured approximately 10–20 ppm, remaining within the stable target range. Drained roughly 90% of the sump and about 75% of the display. Fertilizers were dosed only once during the past week, reflecting lower nutrient demand and overall system stability. No additional adjustments were required during this maintenance cycle. The system continues to show steady balance heading into the new year.",
