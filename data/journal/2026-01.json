    "body": "Performed the weekly water change and minor plant adjustments. Pre–water change nitrate levels tested just under 40 ppm. Completed the usual large maintenance drain with approximately 95% of the sump and ~80% of the display water removed. Completed light replanting of the tri-color lotus, repositioning growth for better spacing and continued development. No other major changes were made during this maintenance session. System remains stable following maintenance.",

    "body": "Performed routine maintenance and a partial water change. Pre–water change nitrate levels tested between 20–40 ppm (below 40), and the display tank was drained by about 50%, less than usual, because extra filter maintenance was completed during this session. All filter media were temporarily removed and gently squeezed out in tank water, and the filter chamber was cleaned to remove accumulated detritus and suspended particles, making this a maintenance-focused reset rather than a corrective water change. Newly added shrimp introduced 2–3 days prior are acclimating well and showing active, exploratory behavior throughout the tank. Inkbird temperature probes were moved from the sump back into the display tank to improve monitoring and regulation during water changes, with a dedicated sump heater considered for the future.",

    "body": "Updated the display and sump/refugium lighting schedule with a gentle, split increase to encourage soft green algae as a natural food source for snails and shrimp while keeping the system balanced. Extended the photoperiod by adding 15 minutes to both dawn and dusk, and lengthened refugium lighting with intentional overlap. Moss growth in the refugium has been strong, signaling the system can handle the slightly longer light window.",

    "title": "First Water Change of the Year",
    "body": "Performed the first water change of 2026 as part of routine system maintenance. Pre–water change nitrate levels measured approximately 10–20 ppm, remaining within the stable target range. Drained roughly 90% of the sump and about 75% of the display. Fertilizers were dosed only once during the past week, reflecting lower nutrient demand and overall system stability. No additional adjustments were required during this maintenance cycle. The system continues to show steady balance heading into the new year.",
