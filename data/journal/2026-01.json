    "body": "Updated the display and sump/refugium lighting schedule with a gentle, split increase to encourage soft green algae as a natural food source for snails and shrimp while keeping the system balanced. Extended the photoperiod by adding 15 minutes to both dawn and dusk, and lengthened refugium lighting with intentional overlap. Moss growth in the refugium has been strong, signaling the system can handle the slightly longer light window.",

    "title": "First Water Change of the Year",
    "body": "Performed the first water change of 2026 as part of routine system maintenance. Pre–water change nitrate levels measured approximately 10–20 ppm, remaining within the stable target range. Drained roughly 90% of the sump and about 75% of the display. Fertilizers were dosed only once during the past week, reflecting lower nutrient demand and overall system stability. No additional adjustments were required during this maintenance cycle. The system continues to show steady balance heading into the new year.",

    "quick_facts": "Nitrate 10–20 ppm; ~90% sump / ~75% display WC; single fertilizer dose this week",
