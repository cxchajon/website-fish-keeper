    "title": "First Water Change of the Year",
    "body": "Performed the first water change of 2026 as part of routine system maintenance. Pre–water change nitrate levels measured approximately 10–20 ppm, remaining within the stable target range. Drained roughly 90% of the sump and about 75% of the display. Fertilizers were dosed only once during the past week, reflecting lower nutrient demand and overall system stability. No additional adjustments were required during this maintenance cycle. The system continues to show steady balance heading into the new year.",
