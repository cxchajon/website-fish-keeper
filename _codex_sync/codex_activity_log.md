[2025-10-08 | Stocking Advisor | Filtration→Bioload]
Scope: Add filter dropdown + mild flow factor (±10%).
Result: GPH displayed and bioload adjusted; UI aligned with planted toggle.

Scope: Mounted Filter Type beside Planted; restored visibility and mild ±10% effect.

Next: Consider carrying planted toggle and filtration selection in future (e.g., &planted=1&filter=HOB).
