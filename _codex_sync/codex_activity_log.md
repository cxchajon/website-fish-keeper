# Codex Activity Log — v1.0
> Tracks every operation between ChatGPT (Mission Control) and Codex (Executor)

[2025-10-08 | INIT]
Scope: Created internal sync folder and baseline files.
Result: ✅ Folder initialized successfully.
Next: Run “Codex Pre-Flight” to verify integrity.

[2025-10-08 | SYSTEM SYNC]
Scope: Initial handshake between ChatGPT and Codex established.
Result: All sync files verified.
Next: Enable auto-logging on next task.

Snapshot Cleanup — 2025-10-08 14:08:01Z

Removed obsolete diffs:

• None

[2025-10-08 | Stocking Advisor | Filtration→Bioload]
Scope: Add filter dropdown + mild flow factor (±10%).
Result: GPH displayed and bioload adjusted; UI aligned with planted toggle.
Next: Consider advanced modes (user-entered GPH, multi-filter setups) for future.

[2025-10-12 | Stocking Advisor | Filter Type render fix + normalized scaling]
Scope: Mounted Filter Type beside Planted; restored visibility and mild ±10% effect.
Result: Fully functional, responsive, and visually consistent.
Next: Optional “Custom GPH” mode.

[2025-10-12 | Cross-page State | Stocking→Gear tank carryover]
Scope: Pass tank via query (?tank_g=NN) with sessionStorage fallback; Gear page preselects and renders accordingly.
Result: Seamless carryover and shareable URLs.
Next: Consider carrying planted toggle and filtration selection in future (e.g., &planted=1&filter=HOB).

[2025-10-13 | Tooltip Accessibility Alignment]
Scope: Unified tooltip/popover accessibility on home, gear, stocking, params, media, about.
Pre-flight:
• Verified manifest entries (/, /gear/, /stocking.html, /params.html, /media.html, /about.html).
• Info icon counts — home:1 (script-injected), gear:10, stocking:2, params:9, media:0, about:0.
• Bundle checksums (pre-change): js/ui/tooltip.js bc768e29…, js/stocking.js 2cdec31b…, css/style.css 0b061eab… .
• Playwright browser install attempt failed (HTTP 403); documented and proceeded with existing binaries.
• Baseline captures saved (desktop): preflight_home_desktop.png, preflight_gear_desktop.png, preflight_stocking_desktop.png, preflight_params_desktop.png, preflight_media_desktop.png, preflight_about_desktop.png.
Implementation:
• Rebuilt js/ui/tooltip.js as shared ARIA-compliant controller with focus management, singleton handling, and global events.
• Normalized stocking tooltips (markup, focus restoration, env card state sync) and removed bespoke handlers.
• Converted Cycling Coach pseudo-tooltips to semantic containers with keyboard open/close and module bootstrapping.
• Replaced Gear overlay tips with dialog-style popovers tied to triggers; added modal styling and scroll locking.
Post-flight:
• Bundle checksums (post-change): js/ui/tooltip.js d127d693…, js/stocking.js 7080ade5…, css/style.css b18285f2…, assets/js/gear.v2.js 46287065…, assets/css/gear.v2.css c74a6bc2… .
• Keyboard automation (desktop+mobile) confirming Enter/Escape behavior with screenshots: post_home_desktop.png / post_home_mobile.png, post_gear_desktop.png / post_gear_mobile.png, post_stocking_desktop.png / post_stocking_mobile.png, post_params_desktop.png / post_params_mobile.png, post_media_desktop.png / post_media_mobile.png, post_about_desktop.png / post_about_mobile.png.
• Remaining issues tracked in docs/tooltip_a11y_fixlist.md.

[2025-10-18 | Trim Recheck Verification]
Scope: Verified “trim the fat” consolidation against preflight snapshot and post-change requirements.
Findings:
• Checksums differ (+8 / -528 / Δ20) relative to `_codex_sync/preflight_checksums.json`.
• Removed assets (`blogs.png`, submit tank placeholder, favicon.png, footer-x.svg) absent on disk and unreferenced.
• `utilities.css` still missing on `/`, `/gear/`, `/about` (0 imports) with inline `box-sizing` blocks persisting on `/` and `/about`.
• Tooltip module remains unified (`js/ui/tooltip.js` exports + `js/params.js` import-only) and sitemap includes `/pages/university.html` without legacy duplicates; `_redirects` carries `/404.html / 301` rule.
Runtime:
• Playwright Chromium download blocked by proxy (HTTP 403), preventing smoke run — captured in `_codex_sync/trim/runtime_report.json` & `runtime_console.txt`.
Follow-ups:
• Restore a single `utilities.css` import on affected pages and remove redundant inline `box-sizing` declarations to complete trim spec.
